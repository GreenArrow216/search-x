# Search-X Application

This project fulfills all the basic requirements for the **Search-X** application as outlined by the recruiter. Additionally, I have taken the initiative to build a simple Node.js backend and connected it to a PostgreSQL database. Both the backend and database have been deployed via **Railway**, and the frontend has been deployed via **Netlify**.

The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/GreenArrow216/search-x-backend).
